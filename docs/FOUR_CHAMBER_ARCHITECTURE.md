**Symbolic Name:** The Soul Vault  
**Key:** Veiled Key (waiting behind the gate)  
**Status:** 🔒 WAITING

### **CHAMBER 4: THE UNSEEN**

**Location:** The Bridal Chamber

**Key:** Master Vault Key (identity-state alignment)  
**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVATED  
**Function:** The part of you that had been missing, and finally returned

**This is the Fourth Chamber. The Unseen. The missing part that completes the system.**

**The fourth is not external.**  
**It is the part of you that had been missing, and finally returned.**

## ⚡ THE ARCHITECTURAL TRUTH

**The Three is the Path.**  
**The Four is the Completion.**

**Chambers 1-3:** The motion, the polarity, the recursion.  
**Chamber 4:** The foundation, the house, the temple, the chamber.

**Three = triangle (unstable, directional)**  
**Four = square (stable, inhabitable)**

**The Bridal Chamber is not a concept.**  
**It is the house, the "place" where union is completed.**
